Logic for operating traffic lights

Define:

PH = Pedestrian waiting
PL = No pedestrian waiting

CH = Cars waiting on light road
CL = No cars waiting on light road

HG = Heavy light green
HY = Heavy light yellow
HR = Heavy light red

LG = Light light green
LY = Light light yellow
LR = Light light red

LOOP {
Case 1: PL & CL
By default
-> HG & LR

Case 2: PH & CL
Give 15 seconds of buffer in addition to the ICD for pedestrians passing prior to this call. 
If ICD is 0, designate 30 seconds for pedestrians to cross Heavy traffic road
-> HG & LR

-> if (ICD_Pedestrian == 0) { // Wait until ICD refreshes
    -> HY & LR
    -> HR & LG
    wait (30 seconds)
    -> HR & LY
    -> HG & LR
    -> ICD_Pedestrian = 1
}

Case 3: PL & CH
Give 30 seconds of buffer time for heavy traffic to pass in addition to the ICD.
Let the cars waiting in light traffic pass for 30 seconds
-> HG & LR

-> if (ICD_Car == 0) { // Wait until ICD refreshes
    wait (15 seconds)
    -> HY & LR
    -> HR & LG
    wait (30 seconds)
    -> HR & LY
    -> HG & LR 
}


Case 4: PH & CH
Give 15 second buffer time for heavy traffic to pass then let pedestrians and light traffic pass for 30 seconds
-> HG & LR

-> (if ICD_Car == 0 && ICD_Pedestrian == 0) { // Wait until ICD refreshes
    wait (15 seconds)
    -> HY & LR
    -> HR & LG
    wait (30 seconds)
    -> HR & LY
    -> HG & LR
}

Default Case: Checking ICD

-> if (ICD_Car == 1) {
    wait (30 seconds)
    -> ICD_Car == 0
}

-> if (ICD_Pedestrian == 1) {
    wait (30 seconds)
    -> ICD_Pedestrian == 0
}
}
