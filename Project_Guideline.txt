Traffic Light Project:

Design, and prototype a Traffic Light

The traffic light is at an intersection that has heavy traffic in one direction and light traffic in the other. 
The heavy traffic is given the priority by default. There are two switch inputs, one indicating that cars are waiting on the light road,
the other indicating that a pedestrian is waiting to cross the heavy traffic lane.

All lights and switches are in a single location with 4 wires running to it.
It is sufficient to have 3 LED's in each direction to demonstrate proper operation

The I2C port expansion chips that is available for this task are PCF8574.

There is liberty in the time spent between each intermission of lights, and which group receives priority under a jammed situation.

The Design Package should include:
- specifications
- a state diagram
- schematic
- bill of material
- code
- a working prototype
